// Remove them if you want to use values from strings.lst
// 4) _everything.txt version of this file is intended to be used if you
// don't want to rely on strings.lst nor on non-free translations
// 5) _nostringslst.txt version of this file is intended to be used if you
// WANT to rely on strings.lst but still don't want non-free translations
// 6) _stripped.txt version of this file is intended to be used if you
// WANT to rely on original game files(both strings.lst and non-free translations)
