// How to work with this file:
// 1) This file must be called mainui_x.txt, where x is your language in lower case
// 2) Tokens on left are original strings, on right is translation
// 3) StringsList_x where x is number is strings from strings.lst.
// Remove them if you want to use values from strings.lst
// 4) _everything.txt version of this file is intended to be used if you
// don't want to rely on strings.lst nor on non-free translations
// 5) _nostringslst.txt version of this file is intended to be used if you
// WANT to rely on strings.lst but still don't want non-free translations
// 6) _stripped.txt version of this file is intended to be used if you
// WANT to rely on original game files(both strings.lst and non-free translations)
